                <p class="mt-4 mx-3">
                    Canvas apps allow you to design highly customized and flexible applications. They provide a blank 
                    canvas where you can drag and drop various controls, such as buttons, forms, galleries, and media elements.
                    You can then configure these controls and connect them to data sources like SharePoint, Excel, or Common
                    Data Service (CDS). Canvas apps are more suitable for building user interfaces that require extensive 
                    customization and design flexibility.

                <p class="mt-4 mx-3">
                    Model-driven apps are more data-centric and are built on top of the Common Data Service (CDS).
                    The Common Data Service provides a unified and secure data platform that allows you to store and manage 
                    business data used by model-driven apps. Model-driven apps provide pre-built components like grids, forms,
                    charts, and dashboards that are automatically generated based on the data model. They offer a structured
                    and standardized approach to application development, making it easier to build apps that leverage the 
                    underlying data schema.

                    Power Apps Portals, previously known as Power Pages or Dynamics 365 Portals, are designed to extend the capabilities
                    of your Model-Driven apps to external users. With Power Apps Portals, you can build public-facing websites or portals 
                    where external users can interact with the data stored in your Model-Driven apps. It allows you to create custom web pages,
                    forms, and content to engage with customers, partners, or other external stakeholders.
